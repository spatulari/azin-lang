## Key Design Philosophies

Azin bridges the gap between low-level performance-critical systems development and modern, highly expressive syntax language mechanics.

* **Explicit Block Scoping:** Replaces traditional brace nesting (`{}`) with clean, unambiguous `do` / `end` scope structures.
* **Statically Typed:** Highly rigid compiler-enforced types to eliminate runtime type safety bugs.
* **Minimalist Punctuation:** Intentionally engineered to limit visual noises like required line-ending semicolons or excessive symbol chains where structures are already implied.
* **Systems Architecture Native:** Completely free from heavy runtime garbage collection constraints, built for direct compilation targets.

## Language Showcase

Here is a quick glance at writing code in Azin:

### Structs and Pure Functions
```az
struct Point is
    x: int;
    y: int;
end

fn distance(a: Point, b: Point): int do
    return abs(a.x - b.x) + abs(a.y - b.y);
end
```
